      <h3>EXPERT TIPS</h3>
      <p>
        Use an ice-cream scoop to make perfectly shaped cookies. Level off the
        dough on the edge of the bowl for perfectly round cookies. If you didn't
        think these cookies could get any better, think again! Get creative use with
        1/2 cup each of semisweet chocolate chips, peanut butter chips or
        butterscotch chips instead of the 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips. OMG
        these are good!
